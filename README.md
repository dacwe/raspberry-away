# Raspberry away

Some scripts for a raspberry that isn't so close to home.

Both to get a reliable VPN connection and if we annot access it a simple SMS interface.

## Hardware and software

* Raspberry Pi 3
* USB SSD (not relly recommended)
* Brovi modem
* Home Assistant
* Relay to control some heating
